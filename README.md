# iXing Mobile APP
This is a project for HACKOHIO 2018
iXing is an Android app to show the traffic jam in a map in Ohio. 
#### contributor: Luyu Liu, Jialin Li, Yuxiao Zhao

## Idea
We use the traffic camera data to detect the cars and determine if there is a jam in the intersection ahead.

## Data
The data comes from http://www.ohgo.com/.
